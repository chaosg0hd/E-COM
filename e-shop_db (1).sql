Originally the word referred to a literal bread board, a polished piece of wood used when slicing bread. In the 1970s the solderless breadboard became available and nowadays the term \"breadboard\" is commonly used to refer to these. Because the solderless breadboard does not require soldering, it is reusable.', '', ''),

These LAN tester can be used in the workplace and are ideal for technical service professionals and network administrators. These LAN testers can determin e IP addresses, identify polarity, connected port and link connectivity. Furthermore, they can test fibre optic cables.', '', ''),

Origins of UTP Cable Alexander Graham Bell was the first person to make a UTP cable by simply twisting two wires together. The basic design has changed little since 1881, and is still a pair of single conductors wrapped around each other inside an insulated jacket.\r\n', '', ''),
(44, '4', 'Soldering Iron', 350, 10, 'A soldering iron is a hand tool used in soldering. It supplies heat to melt solder so that it can flow into the joint between two workpieces. A soldering iron is composed of a heated metal tip and an insulated handle. Heating is often achieved electrically, by passing an electric current (supplied through an electrical cord or battery cables) through a resistive heating element.', '', ''),
(45, '5', 'Resistor', 15, 100, 'A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.', '', ''),
(46, '6', 'LED (Light-emitting Diode)', 5, 50, 'A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor. ', '', ''),

Each plug has eight locations spaced about 1 mm apart into which individual wires are inserted using special cable crimping tools. The industry calls this type of connector8P8C, shorthand for eight position, eight contact. Ethernet cables and 8P8C connectors must be crimped into the RJ45 wiring pattern to function properly.', '', ''),

A more sophisticated option is a multimeter , which can read voltage levels as well as other measurements, including amperage and resistance.', '', '');
